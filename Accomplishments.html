                <h2>A Defender of the State</h2>
                <p>At the young age of 9, Leopold received the title of Duke of Brabant, and he served in the army until he ascended to the throne.
                By that time, he had reached the rank of Lieutenant-General. His experiences in the military would come to shape his views on military
                and the defense of state as he became king. </p>

                <h2>A Man of the People</h2>
                <p>On the home front, Leopold II has done much for the Belgium public. He enacted policies benefitting the working class, such as
                the right to unionize, as well as universal male suffrage. As a ruler, Leopold has increased the say of the everyday Belgian in
                how the country was run.</p>

                Overseas colonies, such as those in Africa, will be the key to the continued power and greatness of the Belgian Empire.</p>
